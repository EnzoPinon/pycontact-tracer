# PyTracer: A Contact Tracing App in Python

```
python run.py
```

## What is PyTracer?
- PyTracer is an Open-Source Contact Tracing App written **purely** in Python. No other langs here!
- This program has been written by Lorenzo Pinon, a Computer Engineering student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (Sta Mesa, Manila).
- Our Goal: To provide a user-friendly and reliable Contact Tracing App to all establishments without needing to pay for anything. Simple.

## Features:
- Generate Health Declaration Forms with proper results to determine whether one should go to their destination or stay at home
- Exact searching of Health Declaration Forms with exact Date and Time
- User Friendly experience!!!

## Bug Reports and Other Notes:
- From this app, it could be further improved to have its own cloud database with an active account creation system, but that's for another time.
- If there's bugs or suggestions, feel free to open an issue and I will look into it!
